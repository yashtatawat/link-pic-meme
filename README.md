This was my first AI project with AWS services , i just used aws services like create API, S3 container, AWS rekognition facial expressons AI, and lambda services all in free tier.
in s3 i have created a bucked and in this bucked i have created two folders of rejected and approved memes. and on API i created a simple post page link.
in code i have given some face parameters with a dominant parameter of whethere the face is smiling or not. while other are darkenss , brightness ,reality etc comparable params.
i am attaching code file with the live testing video on postman services (app) . i dont have used here EC2 insctance for deploying my website. i will try to do it in future ASAP.
